    <p>There was a small village surrounded by mountains and lush green fields. The people there were hardworking and friendly. In the morning, as

    fields, while the elders sat under the trees, sharing stories. The air in the village carried a unique peace that gets lost in the noise
    and chaos of the city.</p><Br><br>
